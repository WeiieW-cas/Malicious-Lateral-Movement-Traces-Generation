## Lateral Movement walks-related Features 
There is a definition left somewhat ambiguous in Section 3.2, lateral movement walk features. Our paper said the length of a walk is the sum of weights on the walk but did not further explain how to calculate the weight. In fact, the weight between two nodes on the walk is the inner product between two node embedding vectors.
